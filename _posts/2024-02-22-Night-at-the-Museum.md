Night at the Museum was a lot better than I had expected. My group's area in Mr. Lopez's classroom had a small to medium size crowd. Some people were very enthusiatic about our game, like parents or other people in computer science. Things that were difficult were getting people's attention while explaining the game to them. Some people were very intrested in trying to beat the game, instead of listening on how it was made. Others were intrested in how to play the game and how it works.
