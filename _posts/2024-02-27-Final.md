In the trimester 1 game, the player is a box and the enemy is a ninja. There is a city background and a house to the right. This game was made my five people. I am very proud to see how far I have come from this game.

For the Mario Game 1.0, I added all the stuff from the lessons before winter break. The hardest part was implementing lopez and his unique characteristics in the third level. I remember struggling so badly trying to implement this two days before break. Right after winter break, I successfully fixed it in the player.js file.

In level 4, I made the level a presidential theme. There is a trump loading screen in the level. The main things that are changed include Trump as a player, a rainbow goomba, and a White House background. There a things that are reused from the trimester 1 game such as the road and the house. To finish the level, you have to walk into the house.
